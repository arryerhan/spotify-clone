# spotify-clone
This is my another project,it is a basic Spotify clone created as part of my coding journey, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project showcases my front-end web development skills through a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows music playback. I designed the interface with HTML and CSS, and implemented JavaScript for user interactions like play, pause, and next controls. Additionally, you gained experience with version control using Git and GitHub.

#Features:
- Responsive Design: Adapts to various screen sizes.
- Classified Design Components: Organized interface elements for clarity.
- Simple User Interface: Intuitive controls for easy navigation.
